                        In the far land of Alaska, there lived a pack of wolves named Wolfram. Usually, the wolves have a position within the pack. Luther and Tasha, being the alpha; Adalwolf and Lupus, the beta; and Rudi and Kamau, being the omega of the pack. Even though there are two leaders within their pack, Luther is the one who controls them. He's not a leader who listens to the other members. He is a narcissist, irresponsible, and disrespectful.

                    <p>
                        In literature, a fable (pronounced fey-buhl) is a short fictional story that has a moral or teaches a lesson. Fables use humanized animals, objects, or parts of nature as main characters, and are therefore considered to be a sub-genre of fantasy.
                        <br><br>
                        The word fable comes from the Latin "fābula," meaning discourse or story.
