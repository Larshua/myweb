                <h2>The Story of Alpha</h2><br>
                <p>
                    In the far land of Alaska, there lived a pack of wolves named Wolfram. Usually, the wolves have a position within the pack. Luther and Tasha, being the alpha; Adalwolf and Lupus, the beta; and Rudi and Kamau, being the omega of the pack. Even though there are two leaders within their pack, Luther is the one who controls them. He's not a leader who listens to the other members. He is a narcissist, irresponsible, and disrespectful. That causes the other wolves to be enraged toward him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One day as the pack was resting, Luther started to get hungry so he ordered the pack to go hunting for him. The other wolves were furious at him once again but they couldn't do anything other than follow his instruction.

                        <strong>Luther:</strong> I’m still hungry. Hey! Look for something to eat.<br>
                        <strong>Tasha:</strong> If you're hungry, then go find something to eat. Why would you need to order us?<br>
                        <strong>Lupus:</strong> Wait, what? We just hunted and ate a while ago; do you have a shark in your stomach? You don’t get full quickly?<br>
                        <strong>Luther:</strong> Are you saying that I don’t have the right to eat after such a small food you have served me? You're lucky that I even left you food!<br>
                        <strong>Lupus:</strong> You mean the leftovers? Why should I be thankful for that when– <br>
                        <strong>Kamau:</strong> Lupus, stop! Let's just respect him and go for a hunt.

                    As they were scavenging the forest in search of their food, Tasha thought of something to teach Luther a lesson.

                        <strong>Lupus:</strong> That ruthless alpha is getting on my nerves!<br>
                        <strong>Adalwolf:</strong> He didn't even bother to ask us if we were still fine. Look, Rudi still has a flesh wound from hunting.<br>
                        <strong>Rudi:</strong> Well, don't you guys think he’s too much?<br>
                        <strong>Tasha:</strong> You are right! He needs to be taught a lesson.<br>
                        <strong>Kamau:</strong> How? Do you have a plan in mind, Tasha?<br>
                        <strong>Tasha:</strong> What if we abandon him and see if he is strong enough to be alone and do what he wants to do?<br>
                        The other members nodded.

                    Because they could no longer tolerate his behavior, they planned to ditch him. Luther, having no idea of what they were planning, was just waiting patiently for the other members to arrive with food. As time passed, he noticed that the members were still not arriving, so he made up his mind to look for them.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    He traveled the forest in hopes of finding them, but he couldn't. As he was looking, he stumbled into another pack of wolves.

                        <strong>Cairo:</strong> Who are you?!<br>
                        <strong>Boris:</strong> Yeah, who are you? How dare you step on our territory?!<br>
                        <strong>Luther:</strong> Luther is my name, and I'm an alpha.<br>
                        <strong>Aziz:</strong> If you're an alpha, why are you alone? Where is your pack?<br>
                        <strong>Luther:</strong> Well, obviously they are missing after I told them to hunt for me.<br>
                        <strong>Vilkas:</strong> Missing? Maybe they just ditched you.<br>
                        <strong>Luther:</strong> "Ditched me?" Why would they do that when I'm their superior and they only rely on me.<br>
                        <strong>Boris:</strong> Then what made you come here? It's our territory; you shouldn't be here.<br>
                        <strong>Beowulf:</strong> What's the ruckus here?<br>
                        <strong>Cairo:</strong> Someone is pretending to be an alpha.<br>
                        <strong>Luther:</strong> No, I'm not! I'm a real alpha!<br>
                        <strong>Vilkas:</strong> Oh, really? Well, you're not acting like one.<br>
                        <strong>Beowulf:</strong> Silence! (with a commanding voice) You, young man, explain yourself!<br>
                        <strong>Luther:</strong> The truth is, my pack has gone missing, and I'm looking for them. Several hours have passed, and they're still not around.<br>
                        <strong>Beowulf:</strong> Why have they gone missing?<br>
                        <strong>Luther:</strong> A few hours ago, I ordered them to go for a hunt since I'm already starving. But ever since then, they are still not coming.<br>
                        <strong>Beowulf:</strong> "All of you." Let's help this alpha find his pack.<br>
                        <strong>Cairo:</strong> But we don't exactly know him. What if this is his trap to attack us?<br>
                        <strong>Beowulf:</strong> Silence! I don't want to hear any objections. Luther, could you tell us exactly where they have gone?<br>
                        <strong>Luther:</strong> "I have no idea where they exactly went, but..." (stomach growls from hunger)<br>
                        <strong>Beowulf:</strong> It looks like you need to eat first before we find your pack.
