                The meet-up between Luther and the other members of the Eclipse pack wasn’t so great, but thanks to their leader, Beowulf, they decided to help Luther find his pack. However, after hours of searching, Luther hadn’t realized how hungry he was. Beowulf shared some leftover food from their last hunt, and they continued their search.
            </p>

            <section class="content">
                <p><strong>Vilkas:</strong> How are we going to find his pack if he doesn't even know where they left?<br>
                <strong>Beowulf:</strong> Let’s take separate paths to cover more ground.</p>
            </section>

            <p>After hours of searching, they still couldn’t find the pack, so they decided to rest for the night and continue the next day. Luther, feeling betrayed, kept asking why his pack had left him. Beowulf tried to comfort him:</p>

            <section class="content">
                <strong>Beowulf:</strong> It’s okay. We’ll continue searching tomorrow. For now, let’s rest and recover our strength.
            </section>

            <p>Luther smiled in agreement. After resting, they had a conversation.</p>

            <section class="content">
                <p><strong>Luther:</strong> Why are you so kind?<br>
                <strong>Beowulf:</strong> What do you mean?<br>
                <strong>Luther:</strong> You’re the alpha of your pack; you shouldn’t have to do all the work.<br>
                <strong>Beowulf:</strong> Then what would I do as the alpha?<br>
                <strong>Luther:</strong> Just rest and make them serve you.<br>
                <strong>Beowulf:</strong> You're not a boss, Luther. You’re an alpha. You lead your pack, and being a leader is about more than just resting while others serve you. You need to be a role model and understand what they go through if you want their respect.</p>
            </section>

            <p>Luther had a sudden realization.</p>

            <section class="content">
                <p><strong>Luther:</strong> As their alpha, I haven’t been a good leader. I’ve been selfish and treated them badly, but I don’t understand why they left me.<br>
                <strong>Beowulf:</strong> Maybe it was meant to teach you a lesson. They wanted you to understand how important it is to treat your pack with respect and how difficult it is to stand alone without them.<br>
                <strong>Luther:</strong> You’re right. I needed to learn something. But the real question is, have I truly learned my lesson?<br>
                <strong>Beowulf:</strong> I believe you have. But only time will tell if you can prove it to them.<br>
                <strong>Luther:</strong> Yes, once I find them, I’ll apologize and admit my mistakes.</p>
            </section>

            <p>The night passed, and the search for Luther's pack continued the next morning.</p>

            <section class="content">
                <p><strong>Meanwhile…</strong><br>
                <strong>Tasha:</strong> Morning, everyone! Time for breakfast. Shall we go for a hunt?<br>
                <strong>Adalwolf, Lupus, and Rudi:</strong> *nods while yawning*<br>
                <strong>Kamau:</strong> *stretches*<br>

                <strong>(Dry leaves rustling)</strong><br>
                <strong>Voice 1:</strong> I think I heard something. Let’s go check it out.<br>

                <strong>Tasha:</strong> Looks like we’re starting the day fighting instead of eating. *gets into position*<br>
                <strong>Other Wolfram:</strong> *surprised but ready to fight*</p>
            </section>

            <p>Suddenly, Luther and the Wolfram members locked eyes. They were surprised to see each other in this place.</p>

            <section class="content">
                <p><strong>Luther:</strong> Wolfram! My pack!<br>
                <strong>Wolfram Members:</strong> LUTHER?<br>
                <strong>Tasha:</strong> How did you find us?<br>
                <strong>Luther:</strong> I was looking for you, and thanks to the Eclipse, I managed to track you down.<br>
                <strong>Tasha:</strong> And who are they?<br>
                <strong>Beowulf:</strong> Let me introduce ourselves. We are the Eclipse.<br>
                <strong>Luther:</strong> Thank you for your help. I owe you a lot.<br>
                <strong>Beowulf:</strong> It was our pleasure. Good luck, my friend. We must leave now.</p>
            </section>

            <p>After the Eclipse pack left, Luther apologized to Wolfram for his actions.</p>

            <section class="content">
                <p><strong>Tasha:</strong> Are you mad at us for leaving you?<br>
                <strong>Luther:</strong> Yes, at first, but now I understand. I owe you all an apology for how I treated you. I wasn’t acting as a true alpha.<br>
                <strong>Lupus:</strong> What a miracle!<br>
                <strong>Adalwolf:</strong> *chuckles* Is that really you, Luther?<br>
                <strong>Luther:</strong> I’m serious! Stop. I know I made it difficult for all of you, but I promise I will be a better leader. I will be your alpha, your companion, and your family.</p>
            </section>

            <p>It seems Luther has learned his lesson, thanks to Beowulf's guidance. Although he knows he still has a long way to go, he’s on the path to becoming the leader his pack needs.</p>
